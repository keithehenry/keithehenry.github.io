Experimenting with the theme's CV layout...

The Basically Basic Jekyll theme has a Curriculum-Vitæ from JSON data generator. 
So for fun, I updated then [exported](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/member-data) my LinkedIn data. Found and used this [LinkedIn to Json Résumé](https://jmperezperez.com/linkedin-to-json-resume) converter. Cut and pasted into this very handy [resume creator](http://registry.jsonresume.org). Uploaded the JSON to GitHub. Created [resume.md](https://github.com/keithehenry/keithehenry.github.io/blob/master/resume.md) with the required YAML Front Matter. Reviewed and repeated only a half a dozen times and voilá... a beautiful [Résumé](/resume.html) page!
