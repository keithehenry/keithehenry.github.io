In early May, [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) opened trial accounts again. I created one and experimented a little. The results were mixed, but very entertaining.

Inspired by my mother-in-law's property in NH, I used this prompt and obtained the following result:

I noticed others in the Discord using the "as" syntax. This photo with "as a 19th-century cowboy on a horse" yielded:

Seeing that the likeness wasn’t great, this quick selfy with “as a 19th-century cowboy on a horse in Sedona, AZ” resulting in:

The same photo with "as a 19th-century cowboy at Monument Valley" yielded:

Pretty funny.

If you want to play around, visit their website, click "Join the Beta," and follow the instructions. Discord can be confusing, but with a little trial and error, it's doable.
