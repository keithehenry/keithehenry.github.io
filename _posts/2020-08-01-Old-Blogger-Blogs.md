Revamping old blogs with Jekyll and free hosting at Github.

Using Blogger export, Google takeout, Jekyll import, Pandoc, and numerous ad-hoc shell scripts,
I managed to revamp two old sad blogs, originally hosted at Blogger, and recreate them here.

What's really surprising is that they can be hosted here at Github, for free, at a domain
(with sub-domains if you choose)
not associated with this one. Free hosting at Github just gets better and better.

Consolidated old blogs into one and reworked, making the new home of everything: [KeithAndLeigh.com](http://keithandleigh.com).
