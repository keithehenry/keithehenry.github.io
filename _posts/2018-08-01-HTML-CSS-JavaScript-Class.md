I'm taking a [HTML CSS JavaScript class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/home/welcome).

The class uses GitHub Pages to post assignments. I did a few of the related tutorials. Who knew you could create and host entire websites using Jekyll right at GitHub? *(Everyone but me probably.)* Very powerful.

[KeithEHenry.com](http://www.keithehenry.com) needed serious revamping so of course - now it's hosted at GitHub using the nifty [Basically-Basic](https://mmistakes.github.io/jekyll-theme-basically-basic/) theme. Pretty awesome, eh?
