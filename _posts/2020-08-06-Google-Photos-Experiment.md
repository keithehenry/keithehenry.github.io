See this [useful resource](https://sites.google.com/site/picasaresources/google-photos-1/how-to-get-a-direct-link-to-an-image).

I use the [Photos Direct Link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/photos-direct-link/dgnaaplaoheafdckphgmpiaodckbcafg) Chrome extension to get a link to the album cover photo. (Just make sure the photo is shared publicly. It's best to test in an incognito window. It ***is*** necessary to restart Chrome after adding the extension and before using it.) The link target is the regular Google Photos album link.

*Update 2023-06-01:*  
Fixed broken links and reworded.
