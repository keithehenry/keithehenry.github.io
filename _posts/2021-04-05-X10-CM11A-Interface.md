My old X10 [CM11A](http://kbase.x10.com/wiki/CM11A) is back up and working! Here's how:

I had an old male-RS232 to unknown adapter with the end cut off. I stripped off the outer insulator and discovered an outer shield, presumably ground, and one brown and one black wire.
I also had [these notes](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3Ly2EBkKP3Ju0IRfNoA2Kt7q1PeDDjdCyUuiW7rhq6Z-pa_PgI56-2UU-aceeE4Jx5Dxj4kav0BhXIQ8Ga6fEh0h1K7K_uVQ8RWITrmCw5HXZRBelM10NY4nTiPEZXlQVsfYaQS_0o4Dg0yJVPULJnD_F_tvzyl8AOYlX1W-5jYI-aT6fs3bykgWZsXW6ovnb-XvqCZYyykRYnCmdxxObTKTo7ZQo2lgZgDiSw0F_LArXrPK5fmgHIkkHzet4lxkKxt9n58brQuRdKjUqhretgE4-mM87PL80NRfRdvYU9z-ekmSiEKVNPKgiUqcTUCW-Ps5Q0n8M44FglneT4VntZJfy9doj-gSQj4BCnMMa8wnFwjmR5qZjrYmsDsIjlYPvc6pJK8khMRtWw-YLR3EzABI_BX1dfR_6KWDQbfhUlY39js6oYMBWOcn2oJIU3oh3EcPwXsaCbDA_vgRWkNIncmEQMKxMU1fOmM8hEDF3DQUBeZQDn-Vbjoh23rYHCHh7WMlj5T7BXdBUGM37B6V3Pru-FalTfav-YBhvEa7sO2w6r0HQVrksvvORbrsd4xp2USMAIrRcFIlRRARZnhB93yhNB-Biyk3hpmQiSY-cTXOwRYStKhcE905BjS7IqLnQdTKsGbUB5Cxyciovr86g8xJCdT94q6mpqm1Y1uCAdFHhIqVdoCY5Dn03K9hZof1WiVgc-4XL5oGrXfnug2bEGtl2g=w1000-no-tmp.jpg) from before, and then verified (with a continuity tester) that the ground shield did indeed connect to pin 5, and that the brown and black wires connected to pins 2 and 3 respectively. Deciphering my earlier notes, the brown wire then should be SIN (serial in to host), the output of the X10 interface.

I had also learned previously that the CM11A would generated a stream of "A5"s after line power is reestablish. I put 2 NiMH batteries in the CM11A and plugged it into line power. My oscilloscope showed the following:

It was alive! But why was the waveform only from 0 to 6 volts? RS232 should be from -12 to 12 or similar.

I sort of remembered that the CM11A used the negative voltage on its input pin to generate the negative voltage on its output. To test this, I fished out a new RS232 converter chip and [this note](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3fRqbOwYhAg9EuXhRdoCVjb2EJmCpPHutMtDdMWLWyNa1VRXgIfi36sf8gFG6BCd1bTIGDKEF8LYRiDyi6YF4W0c3WUOEtCWI0_XlX-CQzkQp6XZbo0eFmnTHI8xZwWo6cj2S0WA1Ighu5rPdga6uZPbA=w800-no-tmp.jpg). I soldered +3.3V and Gnd to the RS232 converter module and the black wire to its RS232 output. Sure enough, now the A5 voltage levels on the brown wire reached rail-to-rail as desired:

Next I soldered the brown wire to the RS232 side, and a green wire to the TTL-level output and verified that the "A5" was now inverted and level-shifted back to 3.3V.  This is good - so-called TTL-Serial.

Finally, I connected the MSP430G2553 Launchpad development board, with all the jumpers removed, and the RS232 module as shown, and tested that I could send data as well (with Putty).
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3cwr0lRRSqNvyGN-tyxWq7NBPd8LqP3KT8Hmw1Rx7vZlUnERC_dM4UYFwzVRoZ4CBpJi3vtJEyWk0oBNbh2iy3zq-CUsEpR7veyRSPdmRB-qXQs1HlWYwJqQ6gfuwKcUzJ3Pfh8xv57sruhuq0vjYssUQ=w800-no-tmp.jpg)

Removing the jumpers isolates the development board's USB to serial emulator from the chip under development. Connecting serial in and serial out is a bit odd - the green jumper, receiving data for the host, is on the second row of pins. Putty must be set to connect on /dev/ttyACM0 at 4800 baud.

Now I had to find some software that worked. I knew "Heyu" would work on Linux, but I never figured out how to use it to program macros.  Instead, I tried another program with a GUI, more like the original: Active Home Vista (2.4.20). I was quite skittish about all the free download sites but [this one](https://www.download82.com/download/windows/active-home-vista/) ended up being legit. Just make sure you *hit the right download button*. :wink: Check the MD5 checksum too.

The .zip file unpacked and the .exe file ran without being installed. I did have some unknown issue at first but after a reboot it worked. I played around with the GUI enough to turn a module on and off and download timers into the CM11A.

Soon afterwards I wrote this blog post mostly so I wouldn't forget how it works. Now that's a very successful geek day!
